#summary Usage of this Maven 2 plugin
#labels usage,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

In order for this plugin to work you first need to:

1) make your server visible from other machines, not only localhost. For this you only need to start JBoss (run.sh or run.bat) using the 

{{{
-b 0.0.0.0
}}}

argument.

2) think about security

Now that your JBoss server is visible to everybody from your network, you should secure 

- the jmx-console (http://localhost:8080/jmx-console) 

and  

- the web-console (http://localhost:8080/web-console) 

using a user/password.

See details on page:

= Usage =

*Step 1*

a) You don't need to check out the project (although you can), just download the jar and pom from:

http://jboss-jmx-maven-plugin.googlecode.com/files/jboss-jmx-plugin-0.1.jar

http://jboss-jmx-maven-plugin.googlecode.com/files/pom.xml

b) Install the downloaded artifact your group repository (e.g. using Nexus) or to your local repository (by executing the below command from the command line: 
{{{ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/location/where/you/downloaded/jboss-jmx-plugin-0.1.jar -DpomFile=/location/where/you/downloaded/pom.xml}}})

*Step 2*

In your project's pom.xml add the following:
{{{
<build>
	<plugins>
		<plugin>
			<groupId>com.google.code</groupId>
			<artifactId>jboss-jmx-plugin</artifactId>
			<version>0.1</version>
			<configuration>
				<serverHost>hostname</serverHost>
				<serverPort>8080</serverPort>
				<jmxConsoleUser>adminuser</jmxConsoleUser>
				<jmxConsolePassword>adminpassword</jmxConsolePassword>
				<restartTimeout>90</restartTimeout>
			</configuration>
		</plugin>
	</plugins>
</build>
}}}

All configuration settings are optional, they use default values unless configured explicitly:

_serverHost_ = the host on which JBoss is running (its default value is _localhost_)

_serverPort_ = the port on which JBoss is listening (its default value is _8080_)

_jmxConsoleUser_ = the name of a user which has permission to restart JBoss via the JMX console (its default value is _admin_)

_jmxConsolePassword_ = the password of the previously mentioned user (its default value is the empty string)

_restartTimeout_ = the maximum time interval in seconds till the plugin waits for JBoss to complete the restart (its default value is _120_). If the restart takes more then this, then the restart attempt is considered failed.


*Step 3*

execute the {{{jboss-jmx:restart}}} maven goal

(e.g. execute {{{ mvn jboss-jmx:restart }}} from the command line of your project's root directory)
