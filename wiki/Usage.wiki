#summary Usage of this Maven 2 plugin
#labels usage,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

In order for this plugin to work you first need to:

1) make your server visible from other machines, not only localhost. For this you only need to start JBoss (run.sh or run.bat) using the 
_-b 0.0.0.0_ 
argument.

2) think about security
Now that your JBoss server is visible to everybody from your network, you mught want to secure its jmx-console (http://localhost:8080/jmx-console) and web-console (http://localhost:8080/web-console) using a user/password.

= Usage =

*Step 0*

Install this Maven 2 plugin to your group (or local, if not using a group repository) repository using the below pom coordinates:

groupId = com.google.code
artifactId = jboss-jmx-plugin
version = 0.1

*Step 1*

In your project's pom.xml add the following:
{{{
<build>
	<plugins>
		<plugin>
			<groupId>com.google.code</groupId>
			<artifactId>jboss-jmx-plugin</artifactId>
			<version>0.1</version>
			<configuration>
				<serverHost>hostname</serverHost>
				<serverPort>8080</serverPort>
				<jmxConsoleUser>adminuser</jmxConsoleUser>
				<jmxConsolePassword>adminpassword</jmxConsolePassword>
				<restartTimeout>90</restartTimeout>
			</configuration>
		</plugin>
	</plugins>
</build>
}}}

All configuration settings are optional, they use default values if not configured:
_serverHost_ = the host on which JBoss is running (its default value is _localhost_)
_serverPort_ = the port on which JBoss is listening (its default value is _8080_)
_jmxConsoleUser_ = the name of a user which has permission to restart JBoss via the JMX console (its default value is _admin_)
_jmxConsolePassword_ = the password of the previously mentioned user (its default value is the empty string)
_restartTimeout_ = the maximum time interval in seconds till the plugin waits for JBoss to complete the restart (its default value is _120_). If the restart takes more then this, then restart is considered FAILED.

*Step 2*

execute the _jboss-jmx-plugin:restart_ maven goal

(e.g. execute _mvn jboss-jmx-plugin:restart_ from the command line of a project's root directory)
